.. warning:: z3c.bcrypt has been superseeded with the new version of
            `zope.password`_ as it now includes `bcrypt` support based on
            the well-maintained `bcrypt`_ library. Please do no longer use
            this package in new projects.

z3c.bcrypt provides `zope.password`_ compatible "password manager" utilities
that use bcrypt (or alternatively pbkdf2) encoding for storing passwords.

Both encoding schemes are implemented in the cryptacular_ library that is
a dependency for this package.
